# Mass balance in multi-pass welding

### Problem Statement
1. Finding the height ‘h’ of the weld bead, assuming its cross sectional profile to be a parabola, for different paths in the 2D plane 
2. Visualizing the results obtained using Python library Matplotlib, which would facilitate in optimizing the welding process.
